summary: Conference talk.
abstract: 'During the last decades the importance of considering data uncertainty in
optimization problems has become increasingly apparent, since small
fluctuations of input data may lead to comparably bad decisions in many
practical problems when uncertainty is ignored. If the probability
distribution of the uncertain data is unknown (or cannot be estimated to sufficient precision),
 a common technique is to estimate bounds on the uncertain data
(i.e., define uncertainty sets) and to identify optimal solutions that are
robust against data fluctuations within these bounds.
This approach leads to the robust optimization paradigm that allows to consider uncertain objectives and constraints.


Optimization problems where only the objective is uncertain arise, for
instance, prominently in the analysis of social networks. 
This stems from the fact that the strength of social ties (i.e., the amount of influence individuals exert on each
other) or the willingness of individuals to adopt and share
information can, for example, only be roughly estimated based on observations. A fundamental
problem arising in social network analysis regards the identification of
communities (e.g., work groups, interest groups), which can be modeled
naturally with the framework of quadratic optimization.


We investigate data uncertainty in the objective function of (standard)
quadratic optimization problems (StQP) while considering different
uncertainty sets, and derive implications for the complexity of robust
variants of the corresponding deterministic counterparts. Our preliminary results
indicate that considering data uncertainty in an StQP results in another StQP
of the same complexity if ellipsoidal, spherical or boxed uncertainty sets
are assumed. Moreover we discuss implications when considering polyhedral
uncertainty sets.'
