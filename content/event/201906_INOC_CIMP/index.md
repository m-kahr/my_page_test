abstract: 'Quantitative methods for data-driven social network analysis have received remarkable attraction from researchers during the last decades. A likely reason for that attraction is the proliferation of online social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube) which provide vast data sets about the structure of such networks as well as about the attributes of its users. Such networks are often used by millions of people that are affected by the propagated information in different ways, for instance, by influencing their consumer behavior. It is therefore not surprising that many entities use social networks for propagating information while benefiting from word-of-mouth effects. A natural objective is to maximize the number of reached network nodes, referred to as influence maximization. This can be achieved by activating certain network nodes that act as seed nodes for triggering a propagation process. In real-world settings there are, however, often competing entities whose objectives may vary. For instance, either all of them aim for maximizing their individual influence, or one of them tries to minimize the influence of the others which is sometimes referred to as rumor blocking. We consider a problem setting in which an entity tries to maximize its influence as a best response to a given set of seed nodes influenced by a competitor. Two propagation processes that occur in a discrete time setting are triggered by the two disjoint sets of seed nodes (one set for each involved entity). Influence propagation to further nodes is based on the well-known independent cascade model (i.e., based on a given probability distribution). We assume that each node can be influenced by at most one of the two entities, i.e., by the one whose influence reaches a node first where ties are broken in favor of the competitor. Since the competitor`s seed set is fixed in our setting, the objective of the deciding entity is to identify a seed set (of given cardinality) that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes triggered by that seed set. The presented models are, however, general enough to deal also with rumor blocking. Unlike the majority of the related literature that focusses on heuristic methods, we aim for solving problem instances to proven optimality using formulations and methods based on (stochastic) integer linear programming techniques. We present computational results and insights from our computational study performed on artificial instances and real-world instances based on Twitter.'
