summary: Workshop talk.
abstract: 'Numerous practically relevant optimization problems confront decision makers with uncertain input data, which naturally arises, for instance, if the true data is revealed in future but needs to be estimated now. Robust optimization tackles that uncertainty by estimating bounds on the uncertain data, i.e., uncertainty sets, and aims to identify optimal solutions that are robust against all data realizations therein. Although it is commonly assumed that uncertainty affects only the constraints, one can, however, safely trust the constraints in several problems, e.g., the Standard Quadratic Problem (StQP), which optimizes a quadratic polynomial over the standard simplex. We discuss the robust counterpart of the StQP and its copositive relaxation, and show that this robustification results in another instance of the StQP when box-, spectrahedron-, or ball-shaped uncertainty sets are considered. 
These findings are applied to the robust variant of the Dominant Set Graph Clustering Problem, which aims to identify homogeneous clusters in a graph, e.g, communities in a social network. The computational experiments indicate that considering box- and spectrahedron-shaped uncertainty sets tend to underestimate the cluster sizes, while the opposite is true for ball-shaped uncertainty sets.'
