summary: Conference talk.
abstract: 'We consider the robust variant of the Standard Quadratic Problem (RStQP), in which a (possibly indefinite) quadratic form is extremized over the standard simplex (which is considered certain), and the quadratic form is uncertain. The uncertain data realizations are assumed to lie in known uncertainty sets, which we model particularly by ellipsoids, polyhedra, and spectrahedra, more precisely, intersections of sub-cones of the copositive matrix cone. We show that the copositive relaxation gap of the RStQP equals the minimax gap under some mild assumptions for arbitrary uncertainty sets, and present conditions under which the RStQP reduces to a deterministic instance of an StQP. These conditions also ensure that the copositive RStQP relaxation is exact. A specific application is community detection in social networks based on profile similarity, for which a computational study is presented.'
