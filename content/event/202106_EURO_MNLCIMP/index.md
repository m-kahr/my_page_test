summary: Conference talk.
abstract: 'A frequently studied problem in the context of digital marketing for online social networks is the influence maximization problem that seeks for an initial seed set of influencers that trigger an information propagation cascade (in terms of message-forwarding) of expected maximum impact. The studied problems typically neglect that the probability that individuals only view content without forwarding it is much higher than the probability that they forward content. We argue that more natural objectives include maximizing (a) the organic reach or (b) total impressions, or, (c) the expected patronage of the influence spreading entity. To model the latter variant, we propose a new mathematical model that takes into account the individual`s resistance to the delivered content and uses a multinomial choice model to model customer behavior. Our model can be easily transformed to account for all of the aforementioned objectives. These models are also geared to a competitive setting in which the seed set of a competitor is already known and contains the problem variants for a single influence spreading entity as special cases. In a computational study based on newly obtained network graphs from Twitter (and from the literature) we show that one can face up to 80% losses in terms of organic reach and total impressions and the expected patronage, respectively, if the classical message-forwarding maximization is used. The performance of our algorithms is compared the performance.'
