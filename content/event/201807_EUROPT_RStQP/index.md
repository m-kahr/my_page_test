summary: Conference talk.
abstract: 'We consider the robust variant of the Standard Quadratic Problem (RStQP), in which a (possibly indefinite) quadratic form is extremized over the standard simplex (which is considered certain), and the quadratic form is uncertain. The uncertain data realizations are assumed to lie in known uncertainty sets modeled by, e.g., specrahedra, ellipsoids or polyhedra. We discuss cases in which the copositive relaxation of the RStQP is exact and reduces to an instance of a deterministic StQP. Computational results motivated by community detection in social networks are presented.'
