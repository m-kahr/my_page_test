abstract: 'Online social networks have become crucial communication channels recently. Millions of people participate in such networks including entities with commercial interests such as companies. The latter increasingly incorporate campaigns promoted via social networks into their marketing mix. Fundamental problems that arise in quantitative social network analysis in the context of (viral) marketing include (i) the identification of influential network nodes that may trigger a large information propagation cascade referred to as influence propagation, and (ii) the identification of homogeneous communities referred to as community detection. In this thesis, we address the aforementioned problems that are naturally subject to uncertainty regarding the input data. Reasons include that the strength of social ties and the homogeneity of individuals can only be roughly quantified by empirical observations. In particular we study three problems from the domain of influence propagation and one community detection problem. The focus is on the development of solution algorithms that allow to obtain optimal solutions or at least worst-case gaps to optimal solutions with methods from mathematical optimization. We thereby contrast with the majority of the related literature in which heuristic methods are used. The proposed algorithms employ techniques from mixed integer (non-)linear programming including column generation and (generalized) Benders decomposition that are both embedded into a branchand-cut framework. We also employ a Frank-Wolfe type solution algorithm for solving quadratic programs. Most of the proposed algorithms are accompanied by heuristics. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated in extensive computational experiments on artificial and on real-world social network graphs from the literature as well as on new instances that we obtained via the developer interface of Twitter. Besides, several managerial insights are derived. The aforementioned uncertain input data is tackled with methods from stochastic optimization and robust optimization. Particularly regarding the latter domain, we propose and formally study a robust version of the standard quadratic problem that we use for a seemingly novel application, namely, community detection. Here, an uncertain (possibly indefinite) quadratic form is maximized over the unit simplex. We show that the copositive relaxation gap is equal to the minimax gap under some mild conditions on the curvature of uncertainty sets that are widely used in the related literature. We further derive conditions under which the robust version of the problem reduces to a traditional standard quadratic problem. Finally, concluding remarks are given including future research avenues.'
