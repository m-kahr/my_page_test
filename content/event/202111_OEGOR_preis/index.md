abstract: 'A frequently studied problem in the context of digital marketing for online social networks is the influence maximization problem that seeks for an initial seed set of influencers that trigger an information propagation cascade (in terms of message-forwarding) of expected maximum impact. The studied problems typically neglect that the probability that individuals passively only view content without forwarding it is much higher than the probability that they forward content. We argue that more natural objectives include maximizing: (a) the organic reach or (b) total impressions, or, (c) the expected patronage of the influence spreading entity. To model the latter variant, we propose a new mathematical model that takes into account individual resistances to the delivered content and uses a random utility multinomial logit customer choice behavior model. Our model can be easily transformed to account for all of the aforementioned objectives. In a computational study based on newly obtained network graphs from Twitter (and from the literature) we show that using our approach can leverage the effectiveness of marketing campaigns up to 500% (in some cases) compared to the classical maximization of message-forwards. A performance analysis of our algorithms is also presented.'
