summary: Conference talk.
abstract: 'We study influence maximization in social networks under competition. In the considered problem setting an entity tries to maximize its influence as a best response to a given set of (seed) nodes influenced by a competitor. Two propagation processes that occur in a discrete time setting are triggered by the two disjoint sets of seed nodes (one set for each involved entity). Influence propagation to further nodes is based on the well-known independent cascade model (i.e., based on a given probability distribution). We assume that each node can be influenced by at most one of the two entities, i.e., by the one whose influence reaches a node first where ties are broken in favor of the competitor. Since the competitors seed set is fixed in our setting, the objective of the entity is to identify a seed set (of given cardinality) that maximizes the expected number of influenced nodes triggered by that seed set. Unlike the majority of the related literature that focusses on heuristic methods, we aim for solving problem instances to proven optimality using formulations and methods based on (stochastic) integer linear programming techniques.'
